MonolithSE is a fork of [Monolith](https://github.com/Monolith-Station/Monolith) that runs on the [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for MonolithSE.

If you want to host or create content for MonolithSE, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.

We provide some scripts shown below to make the job easier.
